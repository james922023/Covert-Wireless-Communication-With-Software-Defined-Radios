# This is where we will store our project code as we develop it.
# The code so far...(9/2/2024)
-HideMessageInPhoto as of now hides a bit sequence 1010 inside the image after the image is converted to black and white. Its converted to black and white for simplicity.

-RecoverTheMessage as of now takes the black and white image and has hardcoded preknowledge of message size. It loops through the image and then extracts the bits, putting it into an array and then spits out the hidden bit sequence into the console.

# The code as of (9/06/2024)

-We are able to embed a bit sequence and decode it from a black and white image and then extract it

-We are able to embed a smaller black and white photo in a larger one and then extract it

-We are able to embed a smaller colored image inside a larger one amd then extract it

-We are able to embed a string or sentence inside a larger one and then extract it
