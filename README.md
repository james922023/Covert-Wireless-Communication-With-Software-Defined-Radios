# The code so far...
-HideMessageInPhoto as of now hides a bit sequence 1010 inside the image after the image is converted to black and white. Its converted to black and white for simplicity.

-RecoverTheMessage as of now takes the black and white image and has hardcoded preknowledge of message size. It loops through the image and then extracts the bits, putting it into an array and then spits out the hidden bit sequence into the console.
